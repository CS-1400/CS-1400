## Overview
Students need to create & upgrade their GitHub and replit accounts, which are free. Then, they should complete an easy, low-stakes GitHub assignment to become familiar with the GitHub assignment process.

Video Walk-through of the student process:

## GitHub Account
1. First, students will need to create a <a href='https://github.com/join'  target="_blank">GitHub account</a> (if they don't already have one).
2. Next, they will need to add their official school <a href='https://github.com/settings/emails'  target="_blank">email</a> to their GitHub account. 
3. Lastly, they will need to upgrade their GitHub account by <a href='https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application'  target="_blank">applying</a> for GitHub student benefits. This will upgrade their accounts to GitHub PRO at no cost.

## Replit Account
Students need to create a "Hacker" account on replit by following <a href='https://repl.it/site/github-students' target="_blank">this link</a>, and clicking the green button.
  - *NOTE*: The upgrade will only work if the student has already been approved for GitHub PRO.


## GitHub Orientation
The GitHub Orientation assignment allows students to use and learn the GitHub assignment process. It is a simple assignment that asks the student to calculate and output simple arithmetic, and to add one comment.
