## Overview
Instructors will need to set up their GitHub assignments before the students can access and complete them. First, they will need to create and upgrade both their GitHub and GitHub Classroom account. Next, they'll create student assignments through GitHub classroom for each pre-made project repository. Lastly, they'll need to add the GitHub URL for each programming assignment into their Canvas class assignments.

## GitHub
1. Create and/or upgrade your GitHub account.
    - <a href='https://github.com/join?source=login'  target="_blank">Join GitHub</a>
    - Add your official school email *(@uvu.edu)* to your <a href='https://github.com/settings/emails'  target="_blank">GitHub account</a>. (this will allow you free upgrades)
    - <a href='https://education.github.com/discount_requests/teacher_application'  target="_blank">Upgrade</a> your GitHub account (free).
    
2. Optional: Complete <a href='https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/5fcbfd62a2c37aca3fe728a635964eaf'  target="_blank">GitHub Teacher Training</a>.

3. The course mentor will invite you to join the <a href='https://github.com/CS-1400'  target="_blank">CS-1400 GitHub Organization</a>.
