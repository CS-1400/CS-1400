## Overview

All assignment repositories are set up for [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) integration. This is an optional, but extremely useful assignment configuration. 

If the decision is made to not integrate the repl.it IDE into the assignments, students would simply work in their own IDE's, then paste their code into the `src/exercise.py` file already in the GitHub repository. All other repository features will still work without replit (automated student feedback, etc). The only features that would be lost would be those included with replit, listed below.

## Benefits
- Students can complete their programming assignments without installing anything on their machines. 
- When Replit is integrated in the GitHub assignment, instructors can enter student's private repositories in repl.it (through the GitHub classroom teacher interface). From there, instructors can use the chat features and code with the student, providing interactive, real-time help and guidance from anywhere.

- Instructors can view the minute-by-minute editing that occured (or is still occuring) inside the repository that is cloned into repl.it.
  - You will see the minute the assignment was cloned into repl.it
  - Instructors can easily see **copying and pasting** that would occur when a student is **plagiarizing** their work.
  - This minute-by-minute record also shows the iterative development process that should be occuring if the student is not plagiarizing.

## Replit Preparation
- **Students** must sign up for a free hacker account for this integration: [video directions](https://youtu.be/ZqzVN47oVr0). 
- **Instructors** are not offered the same free upgrade through GitHub.  
  - To access and open student's private repositories in repl.it, an instructor might need to pay for the replit upgrade.
  - Instructors with older "legacy" repl.it accounts might not need the upgrade.
